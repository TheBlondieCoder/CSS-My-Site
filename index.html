      <h2>Hello.</h2>

      <p class="Intro">

      </p>I am a Web-deveolper in the making. And I am also a Self-made Entrepreneur,
        I am always looking for my next step in life and with coding I feel like I really found a place to be.
        But I also want to always have another option for a plan B if things
        go off the rails. I am a Mother Of three and a wife as well. I have many hobbies
        and a lot of them include my family so I am always going one way or the other.
        I have started coding as a way to make things better for my family and its also another reason why
        I started My side Business.</p>

        <h3>SOME Coding</h3>
        <p>So far I know some coding. Like HTML and CSS and I was going to head into some Java
          classes but I wanted to make sure I could understand CSS better before I moved completely past
          CSS. I am loving learning to code so far and I cant wait to one day make an app or a website.
          I can use to help others.</p>
